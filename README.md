## Fraud-Detection in Email
#### Capstone Project at S P Jain School of Global Managment 

We as students of the Big Data Analytics Program at SP Jain School of Global Management are taking up the project of Fraud Detection in Emails. Our main objective in doing this project is to go through all the workflows in a Data Science project - right from Data Munging to communicating our inferences. 

For stage One, we'll be concentrating on the Data Munging part that involves extracting the data content from the text files and converting them to features that would be used for Supervised Learning. Data manipulation and Feature extraction is a key part of the learnings in this project.
